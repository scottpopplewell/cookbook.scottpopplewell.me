size: Makes about 2 pints
---
- 1.25 teaspoons of sea salt
- 2 tablespoons of sugar
- 5 oz of your favorite chocolate, chopped into pieces (divide into 3 oz and 2 oz)
- 3 cups of the Ice Cream Base (very cold)
- 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil

1. In a small saucepan, heat 1/4 cup water, the salt and sugar over medium heat until the water gives off steam (1 minute or so)
2. Remove pan from heat and add 3 oz of the chocolate to the pan and stir until chocolate is completely melted
3. Let the chocolate mixture cool until room temperature
4. Pour mixture into ice cream base and whisk until smooth
5. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours

After ice cream mixture has cooled

1. Add mixture to ice cream maker and churn
2. While ice cream churns, pour an inch or so of water into a small saucepan and bring to simmer
3. Combine the remaining 2 oz chocolate pieces and vegetable oil in a heatproof bowl and place on top of saucepan
4. Once chocolate has completely melted, turn off heat but leave chocolate on top of the pan to remain warm
5. Once the ice cream has reached a soft-serve consistency, pour chocolate into ice cream maker using a thin, steady stream
6. Transfer ice cream from maker to freezer-friendly container(s) and freeze for at least 6 hours

### Notes
- When the warm chocolate mixture hits the cold ice cream, the chocolate will scatter and freckle your ice cream
