## Ingredients

#### Custard Ingredients

- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons dry milk powder
- 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk

#### Jam

- 1 pint fresh blueberries
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon pectin
- 1 cup granulated sugar

## Process

### Make the base

~15-20 minutes including clean up. Probably longer the first time :)

1. Combine the 1/2 cup sugar, the dry milk powder, and the xanthan gum in a small bowl and stir well.
2. In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and whisk until the yolks are lighter in color, about a minute
3. In a medium pot, combine the corn syrup and the heavy cream
4. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth.
5. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes.
6. Remove the pot from the heat.
7. Start whisking the yolk mixture and continue to whisk constantly while slowly drizzling the hot cream into the yolks.
8. Add the buttermilk and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the base to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours.

### Make the jam

~10-15 minutes including cleanup. Probably longer the first time. Lasts up to 3 months in the fridge.

1. Puree the blueberries in a food processor
2. Heat the blueberry puree, lemon juice and pectin in a medium pot over medium heat until it reaches a boil
3. Stir in the sugar and continue to cook over medium heat until the mixture comes back to a boil
4. Immediately remove pot from heat and let jam cool to room temperature.
5. Chill jam thoroughly before using


### Make the Ice Cream

1. In a bowl, combine the very cold buttermilk custard base, lemon zest and juice and salt and whisk to get the lemon fully incorporated. 
2. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and turn on the machine.
3. Churn according to manufacturer's recommendation.
4. Meanwhile, stir the jam with a folk to loosen
5. Once ice cream has churned, alternate in layers spooning in ice cream and jam into a freezer-friendly container
6. Store in the coldest part of your freezer for at least 6 hours.
