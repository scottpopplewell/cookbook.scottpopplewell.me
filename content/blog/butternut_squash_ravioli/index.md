# Butternut Squash Ravioli

- 1 large butternut squash, peeled and cubed (loosely fills cookie sheet)
- 7+ cloves garlic. peeled, what your heart desires
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, give or take
- 10 whole sage leaves, added the last ten minutes of cooking
- 2/3 cup of roasted pine nuts
- 1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese, freshly grated (separated)
- sea salt and pepper, to taste

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place rack in upper 1/3 of oven
2. Place peeled and cubed squash and garlic on a rimmed cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with enough olive oil that all squash is lightly glistening, sprinkle with sea salt and pepper, toss. Roast at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes but set timer for 40 minutes, adding 10 sage leaves to pan for the last ten minutes of cooking.
3. When squash is done cooking remove from oven. Allow to cool for a few minutes.
4. Place all the ingredients on the sheet pan, 1/3 cup pine nuts, and 3/4 cup cheese in food processor and mix to a thick paste.
5. Make pasta using the ["Pasta Base"](./pasta_base) recipe.
6. Roll out pasta
7. Make ravioli as big or as small as you like. We prefer bigger raviolis for this recipe.
8. Cook ravioli for ~3 minutes — remove from water using a small strainer (allows for batch cooking)

# Brown Butter Sauce

- 1/2 cup butter
- 5 sage leaves, roughly chopped

1. Place one stick butter into a small pan on medium heat, butter will melt, then begin to bubble up. Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the butter. After 4-5 minutes the center will erupt in a caramel color. The butter is now browned. Immediately turn off heat.
2. Once ravioli is cooking in the water, add chopped sage leaves. They will 'fry' in the butter and become crispy.

# Plating
1. Serve ravioli into bowls and spoon butter sauce onto raviolis
2. Dish pairs well with roaster broccoli or brussel sprouts
